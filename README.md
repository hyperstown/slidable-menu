# Slidable Menu 

## Android-Like Slidable Menu Template

DEMO

### Story:

After hours of searching I couldn't find a responsive, well-animated, touch aware, swipable/draggable/slidable side menu that behaves exactly like one in android apps. eg. GMail. Although I found some that kinda works, they didn't work exactly how I would like. That's why I made my own... Kinda. It depends heavily on [Flickity](https://github.com/metafizzy/flickity) as it's really hard to make good responsive animations from scratch.


### Installation

Just download HTML, CSS and JS files from `src/` and integrate those into your project.
Maybe I will make an npm package at some point. If you really think that would be great idea, let me know in an issue.

### Usage

You can change menu width using this CSS 

```css
.menu-cell-1 {
    height: 100vh;
    width: 90vw;
    max-width: 90vw;
}
```

If you need change animations speed, menu drag or anything like that you can checkout how to do it in [official Flickity documentation](https://flickity.metafizzy.co/options).
